## **Having secure passwords has never been so important**

In 2020 most of people stayed longer than ever on line accessing websites or using computers, mobiles and tablets. Everybody across the globe became more dependent of these "digital" assets and tools in order to accomplish their daily routine. Many people have been also obliged to do "on line" some activities they avoided to do before, like shopping, banking, etc... These newcomers, along with more experienced on line users, became victims of lurking cyber criminals specially because they did not protect their on line identity or the access to their digital devices,  which is usually done by proper passwords creation and management.

Here I will share with you some few practical tips not only to set up stronger passwords but also to have a better structured password management strategy. They are really simple but can make it almost impossible for a bad intentioned person to stole your passwords, impersonate you and  have access to your private information, business classified information, email, bank accounts and credit cards, to name a few.

### **Use pass-phrase instead of passwords**

It is curious that the first tip say that you should not use passwords. But please, don't get me wrong. The objective here is that you use something **way better** : pass-phrases. Pass-phrases are longer than passwords : the recommendation is having pass-phrases with at least 20 characters. We name it  because normal humans will not remember a 20 aleatory characters sequence. In order to be able to do so we shall come up with a **phrase** that makes sense and can be easily remembered

> Let's give an example: *"ILoveEatingBarbecuesOnSundays"* : That's a way better password than any 8 character password. But it still can be improved

> **Improvement**: Swap some alphabetic characters by special characters: This password could become: "ILov&E@t!ngB@rb&cu&sOnSund@ys"

Another alternative is to use a password  management tool and to generate a very strong password through a randomized sequence of number, characters, lower case, upper case, special characters, etc... We are going to explore this alternative later in this article.

Why having those "long" passwords or "pass-phrases" is so important ? The time it takes to crack a password by brutal force increases with the number of characters... It also increases a lot if you change the number of "characters in the set", by including special characters, numbers, upper case and lower case.

### **MFA - How you now, have or are (this includes mobile)**

### **Password management tool - use same password every time**

### **Social - don't share password or authentication codes**
