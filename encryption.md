# What is Encryption

Encription consists basically to lock a message so that only who has your encryption key can read it. There are two types of encryption:

- Symmetrical: The two parties share the same encryption key

- Asymmetrical: There is a private and a public key which are mathematically related. One message encripted with the private key can be read by anyone who knows the public key. And vice versa.
